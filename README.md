# de-i2i-gan
data efficient GAN for image-to-image translation

# architecture
The major architecture of G mainly follows the commonly used image-to-image translation networks, which first encodes the input image by a stride of 4, and then decodes it to its original size.

(pix2pix, cycle-GAN, star-GAN)

To improve synthesis realism and diversity for defect generation, we specifically design spatial and categorical control, stochastic variation and layer-based composition for G.

My thoughts
base on star-GAN

1. add skip connection
2. maybe add SPADE
3. use leaky relu with 0.2 in encoder, relu in decoder
4. instanceNorm instead of BatchNorm
5. TTUR
6. SpectralNorm Of course
7. use res-blk in spade
```
The network architecture of D is the same as StarGAN, which includes a D src to distinguish faked samples from real ones using PatchGAN and a D cls to predict the categories of generated defect.

i.e.,Ais acquired by spatial-wisely repeating the target de-fect labelcâˆˆRC. This restriction can be lifted duringinference stage, which enables Defect-GAN to add defectsat different location(s) in a context-compatible mann
